1) make a graph data structure to represent courses and their prereqs
2) for each course prereqs pair, add the prereq to the list of prereq for the matching course
3) create another array to track visited courses
4) DFS to traverse the graph
6) call DFS for each unvisited course, return true of no cycles detected
7) return true if all courses can be completed without violating prereqs
