my approach:
    - create a hashmap where key is letter and value is count
    - iterate through hashmap and count
    - add maximum number of pairs of letters to the length
    - if the count is odd, increase length 1 to include one instance of that character in the palindrome
    - return the length of the longest possible palindrome
