my approach:
- sort list of time intervals by starting time
- keep track of number of servers and end times jobs
- iterate through the intervals and check if a server is free by comparing the start time of the job with end time of ongoing jobs
- if a server is finished, remove its end time from the list
- push the end time of current job into the lest
- the final value is the minimum number of servers required
